# title:        What is a color scheme?
# description:  Discourse lets you set color schemes for your forum. If you want
#               to get a sense of what a color scheme is and why you should care
#               about it, start by doing some background reading on color schemes
#               in web design.
#
#               There are too many different ways to think about color schemes
#               to recommend a specific explanation or course, but I would 
#               recommend trying out some of the color wheel tools or libraries,
#               such as Adobe Color (color.adobe.com). I used the theme linked 
#               in the references for this theme's color scheme.
#
#               In particular, have a think about what colors suit
#               the brand and culture of your forum. How do you want your users
#               to feel when they look at your forum? What associations should
#               the colors of your forum create for them?
#
#               * One thing to note here is that Discourse uses "Color Scheme"
#                 and "Color Palette" interchangeably. They are the same thing.
#                 We're going to use "Color Scheme" for the rest of this unit.

# title:        How to define a color scheme
# description:  You define a color scheme in the about.json file of a theme. If 
#               you look in the about.json file of this theme you'll see an 
#               attribute called ``color_schemes``, where you can define 
#               multiple color schemes. Each color scheme has a name, set as the
#               key of the scheme object, and a list of variables assigned "hex 
#               triplets" in the scheme object. For more on what a "hex triplet"
#               is, and the different forms it can take (6 or 3 digit), check 
#               out the Wikipedia article linked in the references.
#
#               It's worth noting here that you can also define a color scheme 
#               by itself, without anything else in the theme. The process is 
#               the same, so we're not going to cover it separately here, 
#               however check out the meta.discourse.org topic in the references 
#               on stand-alone schemes.

# title:        Color scheme variables
# description:  As we saw in the last step, a color scheme is made up of a 
#               number of color variables. These variables are used throughout 
#               the Discourse CSS to set the colors of different elements. Each
#               variable has a default value, which you can see in the default
#               Discourse color scheme "Light" (see "Customize" > "Colors", if
#               it's not there, just click "New" then select "Light" to re-add
#               it). If you don't set a variable in your scheme, the default
#               color for that variable will be used.
#
#               Let's start by going through the three main variables that every 
#               color scheme should set.
#
#               ### ``primary``
#
#               The primary variable sets the color of text and icons throughout
#               the forum. Importantly the primary color should always have a 
#               high contrast against the secondary color. Shades of the primary 
#               color are also used throughout the forum for design elements such 
#               as borders, shadows, and overlays. That usage is less noticeable 
#               than the text color, however it will contribute to the overall
#               impression the forum creates. It's good to keep this color
#               simple and not particularly eye catching. You probably don't want 
#               to use hot pink here (save that for your "tertiary" color).
#
#               ### ``secondary``
#
#               Think of the ``secondary`` variable as the "background" color,
#               as its main role is to set the background color of the forum. As
#               noted above, it should have a high contrast with the primary color,
#               particularly so that text (primary) stands out on the background
#               (secondary). ``secondary`` also works as a sort of inverse primary
#               color in some situations, in particular on buttons without a 
#               primary or secondary background (e.g. a "call to action" like 
#               "Create Topic" in the composer).
#
#               ### ``tertiary``
#
#               Think of the ``tertiary`` color as the "feature" color. If you
#               have a brand color, it should probably be the ``tertiary`` color.
#               The ``tertiary`` color is meant to catch the eye and stand out
#               to the user. It's used in places like the background for "call
#               to action"  buttons, as the highlight color in the notification
#               list and as the background to topic list item count bubbles. 
#               Again, you want the tertiary to have a relatively high contrast
#               with the primary and secondary colors to make it stand out on
#               the page. This is the place to use hot pink if you're into that.
#
#               Start your color scheme by defining these three variables to be
#               complimentary with each other, and with the brand or feeling you
#               want your color scheme to evoke. Try that out right now by 
#               changing these variable in the color scheme in this theme (hot 
#               pink's hex code is FF69B4. Try setting it as ``tertiary`` :) ).
#
#               Note that when you change a color scheme variable you have to 
#               do a page refresh for Discourse to pick up the new color.

# title:        Color scheme variables (continued)
# description:  Once you've defined your ``primary`` ``secondary`` and ``tertiary``
#               colors, then move on to set the other variables, which have more
#               specific roles.
#
#               ### ``quaternary``
#
#               This variable is used to set the background color of navigation
#               links, e.g. "latest" or "top" in the topic list, or "Summary" or
#               "Activity" in user profiles. Interestingly, the pronunciation of
#               "quaternary" is culturally specific (see the dictionary link
#               in the references).
#
#               ### ``header_background`` and ``header_primary``
#
#               These variables should be self explanatory now we know what 
#               "primary" means in the context of a color scheme (i.e. the text
#               color). A header with a background color different from the rest
#               of the forum can work as a distinguishing feature, or accent, for
#               the forum.
#
#               ### ``highlight``
#
#               The ``highlight`` color is primarily used in two contexts. 
#               Firstly, to briefly highlight posts or topic list items when 
#               scrolling to them or when an action is being performed on them. 
#               Secondly, when hovering over items in the header dropdown menus. 
#               It is also used for highlighting text in posts, which is actually 
#               available out of the box in Discourse using ``<mark>`` blocks in 
#               the composer, for example:
#
#               ```
#               <mark>I will be highlighted!</mark>
#               ```
#
#               This is a bit of a "power user" feature however, so you don't see
#               it that often.
#
#               ### ``danger``, ``success`` and ``love``
#
#               These three variables are used to indicate particular actions, or
#               results of actions, that are generally associated with particular
#               colors, namely (in order) red, green and pink. ``danger``, red by
#               default, is used to indicate deletion, or an error. ``success``,
#               green by default, indicates a a successful action, or a "right
#               answer" (e.g. in the Solved Plugin). ``love``, pink by default,
#               is used for the "like" button, identified by the "heart" symbol.
#               When changing these colors keep in mind that users will have
#               pre-existing associations between those colors and actions. 
#               You'll notice that I haven't set these variables in this theme's 
#               color scheme, which means the default colors will be used for 
#               these variables.

# title:        Using multiple color schemes
# description:  There are three interrelated ways to think about using multiple 
#               color schemes in your Discourse.
#
#               Firstly, it's possible to let your users select multiple themes,
#               and different themes can have different color schemes. If 
#               "Theme can be selected by users" is selected for a theme in the 
#               Theme Admin UI (see Customize > Themes as an admin in a normal 
#               Discourse, not the Theme Creator) a user can select it in
#               their "Interface" preferences. However, if the only difference 
#               between your themes is the color scheme, this is not the way you 
#               should arrange things. You might still want seperate themes if 
#               you want want different CSS or Javascript in each theme, but if 
#               color is the only difference move on to the second way.
#
#               Secondly, you can let users select different color schemes for
#               the same theme. To have one theme with multiple color schemes,
#               add both schemes to the about.json file of the theme. We're going
#               to do that in this theme in the next step. Also make sure that 
#               you select "Color scheme can be selected by users" in the Color
#               Scheme Admin UI (see Customize > Colors). The user will then be 
#               able to select the color scheme they like in their "Interface" 
#               preferences.
#
#               Lastly, you can set a "dark mode" color scheme to be applied when
#               the user's device is in "dark mode". You set that using the 
#               ``default dark mode color scheme id`` site setting. The user can
#               then turn on automatic dark mode switching in their "Interface"
#               preferences.
#
#               Given those different settings, here's a good way to arrange  
#               your theme and color schemes:
#
#               1. Have a single theme with "Light" and "Dark" color schemes
#                  defined in the about.json file. Set the "Light" scheme as
#                  the "Color Palette" for the theme in the Theme Admin UI
#                  (remember, "Color Palette" and "Color Scheme" is the same 
#                  thing).
#
#               2. Check the "Color scheme can be selected by users" box in
#                  the "Dark" scheme, so the user can switch between the
#                  theme scheme (i.e. "light") and the "Dark" scheme in
#                  their "Interface" preferences.
#
#               3. Set the "Dark" color scheme as the ``default dark mode
#                  color scheme id`` so users can turn on automatic dark mode
#                  switching in their "Interface" preferences. Then, if their
#                  device is in dark mode, the "Dark" scheme will automatically 
#                  be applied.

# title:        Creating a dark color scheme
# description:  Now we know a bit about color schemes, what the variables do and
#               how to use multiple schemes, let's create a dark color scheme in
#               this theme's ``about.json`` file.
#
#               Start by considering what the "dark" version of your ``primary``
#               ``secondary`` and ``tertiary`` colors would be. Often, folks will
#               just swap the ``primary`` and ``secondary`` colors. You should
#               start by doing that, and keeping all the other variables the 
#               same. Even if you keep a variable the same, you still need to 
#               define it in the "dark" scheme, otherwise it will default to 
#               _discourse's_ default colors. It doesn't default to the color 
#               set in your light theme's variables. 
#
#               Try creating a dark scheme for this theme and see what it looks 
#               like in the theme creator. Remember, in order for Discourse to 
#               pick up color scheme changes you'll need to refresh the page 
#               once the change is made. Also, as the Theme Creator doesn't have 
#               all the normal Discourse settings you have as an admin, you'll 
#               need to change the "Color Palette" on the theme in the "My Themes" 
#               UI to see the dark color scheme (remember to refresh the page on 
#               your theme preview after you change the theme's color scheme).
